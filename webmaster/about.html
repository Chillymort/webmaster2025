                    Choripan Grill is dedicated to supported local farmers. We realize the importance of <br>
                    agricultural sustainability, and we commit ourselves to sourcing from farms that prioritize <br>
                    sustainable farming practices.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By sourcing from local farms, we eliminate the need for long transportation, which ultimately <br>
                    leads to waste in our atmosphere.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our restaurant is fully vegetarian, reducing gas emissions, soil and water pollution, and resource <br>
                    intensive practices cattle farming induces. We compost organic food waste, reducing the need for <br>
                    chemical fertilizers. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Choripan Grill, we hope to make a real impact on reducing the carbon footprint of humanity, while <br>
                    also providing incredible, vegetarian South American food to customers.
